# 📚 DataNotes Templates & Obsidian Clipper
This repository contains a collection of templates I personally use for my knowledge vaults, primarily managed using [Obsidian](httpsobsidian.md).
While not all templates are perfect, they represent my current workflow for structuring and tracking information from various sources, ranging from academic research to entertainment. I welcome any suggestions for improvements or new sources!

## 🧪 Academic Research & DataNotes Database
The templates under the Database_DataNotes folder are primarily designed for academic use and personal curiosity. They are a continuously growing resource, currently containing sources I have encountered during my studies and research.
### 📝 Core ArticleConference Template
The template I use for all DataNotes concerning academic articles and conference papers follows this structure:

This template is adapted to my specific workflow:
- Obsidian as a TrackerDatabase I use Obsidian primarily as a high-level database or tracker. I create a `.base` note here to maintain a complete overview of the article, including its status (e.g., whether it has been fully read or not).
- Zotero for Annotation The main action focus shifts to [Zotero](httpswww.zotero.org). I consider Zotero the superior tool for managing and annotating academic and university-level book material. All strict article-related notes are taken directly within Zotero.
- Connecting the Tools To seamlessly link the two applications, I use the [Zutilo](httpsgithub.comwshanksZutilo) Zotero extension. This allows me to create direct links that open the specific item in the Zotero application, embedding them into my Obsidian DataNote for quick access. (I am aware of Obsidian's Zotero plugins, but I feel they force the use of Obsidian for virtually everything, which I prefer to avoid.)
